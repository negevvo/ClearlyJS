# ClearlyJS (Preview)

## It is now official - the final version of ClearlyJS and the beta of Craft IDE will be out soon! 

Templates are not avaiable for this version yet.

A preview for the Pre2 version of ClearlyJS with lots of improvements such as modules, components, new tools for managing files and messing with colors (and of course some bug fixes)

**Please note that:**
<<<<<<< pre2-dev
1. Again, this is not the final version and things can be changed.
2. I won't allow any changes to this repo's code \(or copying the code from any file in any branch of this repo\) until I'll release a final version \(will be called 1.0 or something, and I'll let you know\).
3. You can try this version now \(read 1 again!\) in your js file, write: `import clrly from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@pre2-dev/ClearlyJS/clearly.js'`, the code you write need to be inside a module. **Please note that this is a temporary branch.**
=======
1. this is not the final version and things can be changed (In fact, the next version will have some **major** changes).
2. I won't allow any changes to this repo's code \(or copying the code from any file in any branch of this repo\) until I'll release a final version \(will be called 1.0 or something, and I'll let you know\).
3. You **can** use the library now \(read 1 again!\) - put the following in your page's head: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@main/ClearlyJS/clearly.js"></script>` and write your code with defer.
  - From the next version (coming soon) you'll need to import ClearlyJS from your js module, something like: `import clrly from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@main/ClearlyJS/clearly.js'`.
