# ClearlyJS (Preview)

## It is now official - the final version of ClearlyJS and the beta of Craft IDE will be out soon! 

[![Featured on Openbase](https://badges.openbase.com/js/featured/clearlyjs.svg?token=3MyqWPyvyI+UNZ1H3zPts9TEuB81gnjFliZCvKRsN2c=)](https://openbase.com/js/clearlyjs?utm_source=embedded&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=rate-badge)

Templates are not avaiable for this version yet.

A preview for the Pre2 version of ClearlyJS with lots of improvements such as modules, components, new tools for managing files and messing with colors (and of course some bug fixes)

**Please note that:**
1. This is not the final version and things can be changed.
2. I won't allow any changes to this repo's code \(or copying the code from any file in any branch of this repo\) until I'll release a final version \(will be called 1.0 or something, and I'll let you know\).
3. You can try this version now \(read 1 again!\) in your js file, write: `import clrly from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clearlyjs/clearly.js'`, the code you write need to be inside a module.
