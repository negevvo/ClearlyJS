# ClearlyJS (Preview)

## It is now official - the final version of ClearlyJS and the beta of Craft IDE will be out soon! 

Templates are not avaiable for this version yet.

A preview for the Pre-release version of ClearlyJS with lots of improvements such as modules, components, Switcher and Router, new tools for managing files and messing with colors (and of course some bug fixes)

**Please note that:**
1. This is not the final version and things can be changed.
2. You can try this version now \(read 1 again!\) in your js file, write: `import clrly from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clearlyjs'`, the code you write need to be inside a module.
