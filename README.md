# ClearlyJS
Make it simple! A JavaScript library made for making small-scale apps in no time - and without learning a new language!

**Please note that:**
1. this is not the final version and things can be changed.
2. I won't allow any changes to this repo's code (or copying the code from any file in any branch of this repo) until I'll release a final version (will be called 1.0 or something like it, and I'll let you know).
3. You **can** use the library now (read 1 again!) - put the following in your page's head: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@main/ClearlyJS/clearly.js"></script>` and write your code with defer. A real documentation is coming soon, it'll be available [here](https://negevvo.github.io/ClearlyJS/).
