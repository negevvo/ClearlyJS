# ClearlyJS Pre2-dev (Preview)

Templates are not avaiable for this version yet.

A preview for the Pre2 version of ClearlyJS with lots of improvements such as modules, components, new tools for managing files and messing with colors (and of course some bug fixes)

**Please note that:**
1. Again, this is not the final version and things can be changed.
2. I won't allow any changes to this repo's code \(or copying the code from any file in any branch of this repo\) until I'll release a final version \(will be called 1.0 or something, and I'll let you know\).
3. You can try this version now \(read 1 again!\) - put the following in your page's head: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@pre2-dev/ClearlyJS/clearly.js"></script>`, the code you write need to be inside a module. **Please note that this is a temporary branch.**
  - Please note that you'll need to import ClearlyJS from your js file: `import clrly from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/negevvo/ClearlyJS@main/ClearlyJS/clearly.js'`).
4. A real documentation is coming soon, the completed parts are available [here](https://negevvo.gitbook.io/clearlyjs/).
